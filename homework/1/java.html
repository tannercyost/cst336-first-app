                <p>Java is one of the most popular languages to learn.</p>
                <p>It is an easy extension of C++, so it is an easy 2nd language to learn.</p>
                <p>The language also has automatic memory management, which can't be said for languages like C and C++.</p>
                <aside>Java is executed in a virtual machine, making it platform independent. <br /> All Java apps will run the same regardless of operating system.</aside> <!-- aside is a new tag -->
                <p>Functions, called methods in Java, are called by <code>foo(a)</code> where foo is the name of a method and a is the argument being passed.</p> <!-- code is a new tag -->
