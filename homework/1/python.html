                <p>Python is an easy language to learn, but it has many intricacies.</p>
                <p>It has both object-oriented aspects and procedural aspects.</p>
                <p>The language also has automatic memory management, which can't be said for languages like C and C++.</p>
                <aside>Python is famous for being a concise language.</aside> <!-- aside is a new tag -->
                <aside>For example, the following code forms a function which returns a subset of all its arguments.</aside>
                <code>f = lambda x: [[y for j, y in enumerate(set(x)) if (i >> j) & 1] for i in range(2**len(set(x)))]</code>
                <!-- https://wiki.python.org/moin/Powerful%20Python%20One-Liners -->
                <p>Python also can be run in the REPL, which is an interactive shell in which you can run code line by line and it is evaluated immediately.</p> <!-- code is a new tag -->
